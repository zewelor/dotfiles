# Why TERM = "xterm-256color"?
# - Many remote hosts don’t ship the "alacritty" terminfo, causing broken colors/attributes
#   or warnings. "xterm-256color" is widely available and safe for SSH.
# - Truecolor inside tmux is still enabled by tmux (terminal-overrides: RGB/Tc),
#   so even with a 256‑color TERM outside, Neovim in tmux gets full 24‑bit colors.
# - Best practice: don’t set $TERM in your shell (e.g., .zshrc). Configure it in your
#   terminal emulator (here) so remote shells inherit a sensible default.
TERM = "xterm-256color"
